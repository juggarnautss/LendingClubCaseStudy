# Lending Club Case Study

## Goal of Exploratory data analysis:  

``` 

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss 
(called credit loss).Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 
In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of 
loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers are labelled as 
'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
 
Task is to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans 
can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
 
Find out the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, 
i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
Those insights will be utilized for portfolio and risk assessment.
